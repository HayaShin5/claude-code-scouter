## Why?

**Don't know what a command does? Now you don't have to.** This extension tells you whether to approve or think twice — before you click Yes.

## Features

### 4-Level Danger Assessment

Every command is scanned and classified by its real-world impact:

| Lv | Icon | Status Bar | Meaning | Examples |
|----|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| 1 | 🟢 | Normal | **Safe** — Just reading, no changes | `cat`, `ls`, `grep`, `git status` |
| 2 | 🔵 | Normal | **Low** — Makes local changes, easy to undo | `git add`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `npm install` |
| 3 | 🟡 | ⚠️ Yellow | **Caution** — Could delete files or run arbitrary code | `rm`, `kill`, `git reset`, `make` |
| 4 | 🔴 | 🚨 Red | **Danger** — Sends data externally, irreversible, or needs admin rights | `sudo`, `rm -rf`, `git push`, `curl` |

Unknown commands default to **Lv.3** (Caution) so they don't slip through unnoticed.

### What You See

- **Status bar** — Always-visible indicator at the bottom of VSCode showing the danger level + command summary
- **Hover tooltip** — Shows what the command does in plain English (e.g., "Delete files", "Push code to remote repository")
- **Warning popup** — Automatic notification for Lv.4 commands so you never accidentally approve something dangerous
- **Click for details** — Click the status bar item for full command text and the matched pattern

## How It Works

1. On activation, the extension automatically registers a [Claude Code hook](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) (`PreToolUse`)
2. Before every Bash command, the hook script scans the command against 80+ regex patterns
3. The result (level + summary) is written to a temp file
4. The extension watches the file and updates the status bar in real time

**Zero configuration required** — install and it just works. On uninstall, everything is cleaned up automatically.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and available in your terminal
